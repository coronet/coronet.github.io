<p>
David likes explaining complicated things in simple words. He's passionate
about beautiful APIs, low-latency networking, highly-available distributed
systems, and NoSQL databases.
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
In 2007, he got a B.S. in C.S. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.<br/>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
In 2007, David joined the <b>Windows Networking</b> team at <b>Microsoft</b>
as an SDE. He contributed to the
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System/net/System">
System.Net</a> classes in the .NET Framework, and built the low-level
networking APIs for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
Microsoft Silverlight</a>. He learned a lot about asynchronous
programming models, the HTTP protocol, and windbg. He engaged with customers
building low-latency and large-scale networked systems to help them optimize
performance and resource utilization.
</p>

<p>
In 2010, he left to join the <b>E-Commerce Platform Services</b> team
at <b>Amazon.com</b>. He built a highly-available revision-controlled
database for business rules, growing it from a single-tenant prototype built
on a successor of <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">
Dynamo</a> to a company-wide hosted service built on top of a durable
distributed log (which he led the development of). He learned way too much about
the Java garbage collector, the CAP theorem, and how to avoid getting paged
at 2am. By the time he left, the service was used by ~100 teams and serving
hundreds of thousands of requests per second.
</p>

<p>
Since 2013 he's worked for <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, where he contributes
to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/david-at-aws">open-source
developer tools</a>, engages with customers building performant and scalable
applications on top of AWS, helps service teams design developer-friendly
APIs, and occasionally gets paid to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQVYU_zws1k">talk about his cat</a>
in public.
