    Hi! I'm David! I'm an experienced software engineer, operator, and architect. I enjoy learning
    how and why complex systems work, helping people to understand the bigger picture, and working
    as a team to make things better. I care about inclusive communities, reliable services, clear
    communication, and continual improvement.

<h3>Experience</h3>

<div class="experience">
  <div class="header">
    <span>Architect, Elastic Compute (Heroku) @ Salesforce</span>
    <span>2021-Present</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I'm a senior individual contributor working on the AWS-based container orchestration engine
    powering millions of workloads built on the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">
    Heroku Platform</a> and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/functions/">
    Salesforce Functions</a>. I lead a department of four engineering teams by setting and
    communicating long-term technical direction, helping to build yearly and quarterly
    plans, mentoring team members, and working hands-on to deliver critical projects. I'm
    learning a lot about the Linux kernel, aligning with product management, and shifting
    engineering culture.

    <span>Architect, Architecture Strategy @ Salesforce</span>
    <span>2018-2021</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I worked with the Office of the CTO to clarify and improve the company's architecture
    and architectural practices. I did this through writing and speaking about cross-company
    strategic initiatives like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/hyperforce/">
    Hyperforce</a>, consulting with teams in architectural transition, and organizing
    working groups of other technical leaders to drive alignment across the company. I
    learned a lot about clear communication, long-term strategy, and consensus building.

    <span>Principal Engineer, Security @ Salesforce</span>
    <span>2015-2018</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I helped to build out a new engineering function within the Security organization,
    architected and delivered a highly-available on-premises HSM-backed key management
    service, and partnered with engineering teams across the company to drive ubiquitous
    encryption of data in transit and at rest. I learned a lot about random number generators,
    FIPS 104-2, and how to win friends and influence people.

  <div class="header">
    <span>Software Engineer II, Developer Tools @ AWS</span>
    <span>2013-2015</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I contributed to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/aws">open-source developer tools</a>,
    consulted with service teams across AWS to help them design developer-friendly APIs,
    and engaged with customers building performant and scalable applications on the AWS
    platform. I learned a lot about open source licensing, semantic versioning, and backwards
    compatibility in Internet-scale distributed systems.

    <span>Software Engineer II, E-Commerce Platform @ Amazon.com</span>
    <span>2010-2013</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I built and operated a highly-available revision-controlled database for business
    metadata, growing it from a single-use-case prototype built on top of Dynamo to a
    company-wide tier-1 hosted service handling hundreds of thousands of requests per second
    across multiple regions. I led the development of a new distributed log-based storage
    service, the rearchitecture of the database to use it instead of Dynamo, and the
    zero-downtime migration to the new storage backend. I learned a lot about the Java
    garbage collector, the CAP theorem, and self-healing systems that won't page you
    at 2am very often.

    for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
    Microsoft Silverlight</a> (RIP). I learned a lot about asynchronous I/O, the HTTP
    protocol, and windbg. I engaged with customers building large-scale and low-latency
    networked systems to help them optimize performance and resource utilization.
