I enjoy understanding complex systems well enough to describe them to other people in simple terms.
I'm passionate about friendly APIs, highly-available systems, and engineering platforms.
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
In 2007, I got a B.S. in C.S. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.<br/>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
After graduating, I joined the <b>Windows Networking</b> team at <b>Microsoft</b>. I contributed
to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System/net/System">
System.Net</a> modules of the .NET Framework, and built the low-level
networking APIs for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
Microsoft Silverlight</a> (RIP). I learned a lot about asynchronous
programming models, the HTTP protocol, and windbg. I engaged with customers
building low-latency and large-scale networked systems to help them optimize
performance and resource utilization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2010 I left to join the <b>E-Commerce Platform Services</b> team
at <b>Amazon.com</b>. I built a highly-available revision-controlled
database for business metadata, growing it from a single-use-case prototype build on
<a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a>
to a company-wide hosted service handling hundreds of thousands of requests
per second across multiple regions. I led the development of a distributed log-based storage
service, the rearchitecture of the database to use it instead of Dynamo, and the zero-downtime
migration to the new storage backend. I learned a lot about the Java garbage collector, the CAP
theorem, and self-healing systems that won't page people at 2am.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2013 I moved over to <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, where I contributed
to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/aws">open-source developer tools</a>,
helped service teams design developer-friendly APIs, engaged with customers
building performant and scalable applications on the AWS platform, and once
got paid to talk about my cat at re:Invent. I learned a lot about open source
licensinge, semantic versioning, and backwards compatibility in Internet-scale
distributed systems.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2015 I left to join the <b>Security</b> organization at <b>Salesforce</b>. I helped to
bootstrap a software-engineering function within the security organization, architected a
highly-available HSM-backed key management service, and partnered with teams across the
company to roll out encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive customer data. I learned
a lot about random number generation, FIPS 104-2, and how to win friends and influence people.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2018 I transitioned to a new role at <b>Salesforce</b>, working with the <b>Office of the CTO</b> to
clarify and simplify the company's architecture. I do this through writing and speaking about
cross-cutting strategic initiatives, consulting with teams in architectural transition, and
organizing working groups of other technical leaders to drive alignment across the company. I'm
learning a lot about clear communication, long-range planning, and consensus building.
</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
I enjoy speaking at external meet-ups and conferences on technical topics. From 2015-2018 I organized
the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/">Seattle chapter of Papers We Love</a>,
a community built around reading, discussing, and learning more about academic computer science papers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
I've worked remotely since 2016, and VERY remotely (from Australia) since 2018.
