I enjoy understanding complex systems well enough to describe them to other people in simple terms.
I'm passionate about friendly APIs, highly-available systems, and service-oriented engineering
platforms.
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
In 2007, I got a B.S. in C.S. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.<br/>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
After graduating, I joined the <b>Windows Networking</b> team at <b>Microsoft</b>. I contributed
to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System/net/System">
System.Net</a> modules of the .NET Framework, and built the low-level
networking APIs for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
Microsoft Silverlight</a> (RIP). I learned a lot about asynchronous
programming models, the HTTP protocol, and windbg. I engaged with customers
building low-latency and large-scale networked systems to help them optimize
performance and resource utilization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2010 I left to join the <b>E-Commerce Platform Services</b> team
at <b>Amazon.com</b>. I built a highly-available revision-controlled
database for business metadata, growing it from a single-use-case prototype build on
<a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a>
to a company-wide hosted service handling hundreds of thousands of requests
per second across multiple regions. I led the development of a distributed log-based storage
service, the rearchitecture of the database to use it instead of Dynamo, and the zero-downtime
migration to the new storage backend. I learned a lot about the Java garbage collector, the CAP
theorem, and self-healing systems that won't page people at 2am.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2013 I moved over to <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, where I contributed
to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/aws">open-source developer tools</a>,
helped service teams design developer-friendly APIs, engaged with customers
building performant and scalable applications on the AWS platform, and once
got paid to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQVYU_zws1k">talk about my cat</a>
in public. I learned a lot about open source licenses, semantic versioning,
and backwards compatibility in an Internet-scale distributed system.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2015 I left to join <b>Salesforce</b>. I helped to found a software-engineering
function within the security organization, architected a highly-available HSM-backed
key management service, and partnered with teams across the company to roll out
encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive customer data. I learned a lot about
random number generation, FIPS 104-2, and how to win friends and influence people.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
In 2018 I transitioned to a new role at Salesforce, working with the office of the CTO to
clarify and simplify the company's architecture. I do this through writing and speaking about
cross-cutting strategic initiatives, consulting with teams in architectural transition, and
organizing working groups of other architects to drive alignment across the company.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
I've worked remotely since 2016, and VERY remotely (from Australia) since 2018. By
all accounts I've gotten reasonably good at it.
</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
I regularly speak at external meet-ups and conferences on technical topics. From 2015-2018 I organized
the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/">Seattle chapter of Papers We Love</a>,
a community built around reading, discussing, and learning more about academic computer science papers.
