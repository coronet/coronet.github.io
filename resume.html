<h2>David B Murray</h2>

<p>
David likes finding the right way to talk about hard concepts using simple words. He's
passionate about beautiful APIs, well-architected developer platforms, and highly-available
distributed systems.
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
In 2007, he got a B.S. in C.S. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.<br/>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
After graduating David joined the <b>Windows Networking</b> team at <b>Microsoft</b>. He contributed
to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System/net/System">
System.Net</a> modules of the .NET Framework, and built the low-level
networking APIs for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
Microsoft Silverlight</a> (RIP). He learned a lot about asynchronous
programming models, the HTTP protocol, and windbg. He engaged with customers
building low-latency and large-scale networked systems to help them optimize
performance and resource utilization.
</p>

<p>
In 2010 he left to join the <b>E-Commerce Platform Services</b> team
at <b>Amazon.com</b>. He built a highly-available revision-controlled
database for business rules, growing it from a single-tenant prototype built
on a successor of <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">
Dynamo</a> to a company-wide hosted service built on top of a durable
distributed log (which he led the development of). He learned way too much about
the Java garbage collector, the CAP theorem, and self-healing systems that won't
page you at 2am. By the time he left, the service was used by ~100 teams and serving
hundreds of thousands of requests per second with sub-millisecond latency.
</p>

<p>
In 2013 he began working for <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, where he contributed
to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/aws">open-source developer tools</a>,
engaged with customers building performant and scalable applications on the
AWS platform, helped service teams design developer-friendly APIs, and once
got paid to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQVYU_zws1k">talk about his cat</a>
in public.
</p>

<p>
In 2015 he moved across the street to work at <b>Salesforce</b>. He has delusions of
grandeur, and hopes he'll be able to open source them one day soon.
</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p>
David organizes the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/">Seattle
chapter of Papers We Love</a>, a community built around reading, discussing, and
learning more about academic computer science papers.
