  Hi! I'm an experienced software engineer, operator, and architect. I enjoy learning
  how and why complex socio-technical systems work, helping others to understand the bigger
  picture, and working as a team to make things better. I care about inclusive communities,
  reliable systems, clear communication, and continual improvement.

<h3>Experience</h3>

<div class="experience">
  <div class="header">
    <span>Architect, Architecture Strategy @ Salesforce.com</span>
    <span>2018-Present</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I work with the Office of the CTO to clarify and improve the company's architecture
    and architectural practices. I do this through writing and speaking about cross-cutting
    strategic initiatives, consulting with teams in architectural transition, and organizing
    working groups of other technical leaders to drive alignment across the company. I'm
    learning a lot about clear communication, long-range planning, and consensus building.

<div class="experience">
  <div class="header">
    <span>Principal Engineer, Security @ Salesforce.com</span>
    <span>2015-2018</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I helped to build out a new engineering function within the security organization,
    architected and delivered a highly-available HSM-backed key management service, and
    partnered with engineering teams across the company to drive ubiquitous encryption
    of data in transit and at rest. I learned a lot about random number generation,
    FIPS 104-2, and how to win friends and influence people.

<div class="experience">
  <div class="header">
    <span>Senior Software Engineer, Developer Tools @ Amazon Web Services</span>
    <span>2013-2015</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I contributed to AWS's <a href="https://github.com/aws">open-source developer tools</a>,
    consulted with service teams across AWS to help them design developer-friendly APIs,
    and engaged with customers building performant and scalable applications on the AWS
    platform. I learned a lot about open source licensing, semantic versioning, and backwards
    compatibility in Internet-scale distributed systems.

<div class="experience">
  <div class="header">
    <span>Software Engineer, E-Commerce Platform @ Amazon.com</span>
    <span>2010-2013</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I built and operated a highly-available revision-controlled database for business
    metadata, growing it from a single-use-case prototype built on top of Dynamo to a
    company-wide tier-1 hosted service handling hundreds of thousands of requests per second
    across multiple regions. I led the development of a new distributed log-based storage
    service, the rearchitecture of the database to use it instead of Dynamo, and the
    zero-downtime migration to the new storage backend. I learned a lot about the Java
    garbage collector, the CAP theorem, and self-healing systems that won't page you
    at 2am very often.

  <div class="header">
    <span>Software Engineer, Windows Networking @ Microsoft</span>
    <span>2007-2010</span>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/tree/master/System/net/System">
    System.Net</a> modules of the .NET Framework and built the low-level networking APIs
    for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645029(v=vs.95).aspx">
    Microsoft Silverlight</a> (RIP). I learned a lot about asynchronous I/O, the HTTP
    protocol, and windbg. I engaged with customers building large-scale and low-latency
    networked systems to help them optimize performance and resource utilization.

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<div class="text">
  I enjoy attending and speaking at meet-ups and conferences on technical and
  socio-technical topics. From 2015-2018 I organized the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/">
  Seattle chapter of Papers We Love</a>, a community of folks who like reading, discussing,
  and learning more about academic computer science papers. I'm a fan of using, contributing
  to, and creating free and open source software projects.

<div class="text">
  I've worked remotely since 2016, and VERY remotely (from Australia) from 2018-2020. By
  all accounts I'm reasonably good at it.
